# JavaFX application(TextProtection)
The text which you enter in a .txt or .docx format can be encrypted and decrypted using my JavaFX program.
We may save important or cofidential information in some notepads or word document in our Computers. But we may not know that few hackers may access our system remotely using worms/virus. So using my JavaFX application you can encrypt the text in the files which ensures confidentiality, security and integrity. 
When we run the code, a JavaFX application opens and asks for your name. And it also displays two buttons 'LOCK' and 'UNLOCK'. When we click on LOCK button it opens a file explorer to select the .txt file to be encrypted and when you click on UNLOCK button it opens a file explorer to select the .txt file to be decrypted.
